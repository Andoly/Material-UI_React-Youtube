# ReactJS project using Material-UI library components and properties to create Youtube interface

## Available Scripts

In this project I used the following technologies / libraries:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
  yarn ou npm install

Install the dependencies
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` or `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
